# QTPrint
A tiny tool to simulate the "typing effect" in your terminal.
I honestly don't know what I thought when writing this.
I guess it's kind of cool for simulating sci-fi interfaces.
Zero practical usage other than eyecandy, maybe some "ricers" could use it.

This is like the "cat" command, just slower and more [A E S T H E T I C].
